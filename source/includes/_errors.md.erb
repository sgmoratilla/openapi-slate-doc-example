# Errors

Anemone endpoints response a custom body when an error is returned.
It contains a JSON body with the following fields:

* `status`: An error code, dependant of the service, with further explanation of the error.
* `localized_message`: A message localized in the locale of the user describing the error.

`localized_message` was added to allow clients to give users more feedback when they
can't handle the `status` field. This field is current deprecated or always return in English.
The reason is that keeping localization in backend makes it more complicated, forces us
to make deploys just for localization. Every time a language is added we have to re-deploy
all services.

```
{
    "status": "DUPLICATED_EMAIL",
    "localized_message": "This email is already in use. Please choose a different one."
}
```

Anemone API uses the standard HTTP error codes:
